# Ganesh-tatoo.jpg

In the tattoo image you provided, Ganesha is depicted with four arms, holding three distinct objects, while his fourth hand is in a symbolic gesture.

Here is the meaning of each:

1. The Axe (Parashu)
Located in his upper right hand (left side for the viewer). The axe symbolizes the cutting away of attachments. It represents the power to sever the bonds of worldly desires, ego, and agitation, helping the seeker to "cut through" obstacles and find their true path.

2. The Noose or Rope (Pasha)
Located in his upper left hand (right side for the viewer). The noose represents discipline and spiritual focus. It is used to "capture" the wandering mind and pull the devotee closer to the truth. It also symbolizes the binding of difficulties to keep them from interfering with one's progress.

3. The Modak (Sweet Dumpling)
Located in his lower left hand (right side for the viewer). The modak is a sweet treat that represents the reward of spiritual seeking. It symbolizes the "sweetness" of inner joy, wisdom, and liberation (Moksha) that comes from a life of discipline and righteousness.

4. The Fourth Hand: Abhaya Mudra
Located lower right (left side for the viewer). While not a physical object, his fourth hand is in the Abhaya Mudra, the gesture of fearlessness. This open palm facing forward is a sign of protection and blessing, signifying: "Do not fear, I am with you."
